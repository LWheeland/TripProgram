This trip completed `r sets` sets in NAFO divisions `r as.character(divs)`. Total catch was `r round (total.catch,0)`kg, with `r num.species` taxa recorded. Fishing occurred from `r min(depth.range)`m to `r max(depth.range)`m.

```{r topcatch, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

weight.sum <- RV.Catch %>% 
  group_by(Spc_Name) %>% 
  summarize(weight=sum(WEIGHTC)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(weight))

weight.sum$prop <- weight.sum$weight/total.catch$total

```
`r num.species` taxa were represented in the catch, with a total catch weight of `r total.catch`kg. `r as.character(weight.sum$Spc_Name[1])` and `r as.character(weight.sum$Spc_Name[2])` were the most prevalent species, accounting for `r round(weight.sum$prop[1]*100,1)`% and `r round(weight.sum$prop[2]*100,1)`% of the total catch by weight, respectively. Figure \@ref{catchsummary} summarizes the most commonly caught taxa from this trip.

Summarized near bottom temperature from a net mounted CTD is shown in Figure \@ref{temp.plot}.
